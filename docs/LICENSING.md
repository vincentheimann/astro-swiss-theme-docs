## Frequently Asked Questions

### Licensing Questions

**Q: Can I use the free version for my business website?**

A: Yes, for your own business website. No, if you're building it for a client or charging for the work.

**Q: I'm a freelancer. Can I use the free version for client work?**

A: No. Client projects require the premium version. One premium license covers unlimited client projects.

**Q: What counts as a "client project"?**

A: If you're building a website for someone else (individual, business, organization) and they're paying you or you're doing it professionally, that's a client project requiring the premium license.

**Q: Can I use the free version for my company's internal projects?**

A: Yes, if it's for your own company's use (not building for another company as a client).

### Support Questions

**Q: What happens after 6 months of support expires?**

A: You keep the theme and all updates released during your support period. Support can be extended at a reduced rate. The theme continues to work indefinitely.

**Q: What's the difference between community and priority support?**

A:
- **Community Support (Free)**: Post on GitHub Issues or ask on Astro Discord. Response time varies, community-driven.
- **Priority Support (Premium)**: Direct email to theme author, 24-48 hour response guarantee, personalized help.

**Q: Can I get support for customization?**

A: Premium support includes guidance on using theme features and best practices. Custom development (new features, extensive modifications) is not included but can be quoted separately.

### Upgrade Questions

**Q: Can I upgrade from free to premium later?**

A: Yes! Simply purchase the premium version. Contact us for migration assistance if needed - we're happy to help.

**Q: Do I need separate licenses for each client project?**

A: No. Premium includes **unlimited client projects** with one purchase. Build as many sites as you want.

**Q: If I buy premium, do I get updates forever?**

A: You receive all updates released during your support period (6 months included, extensible). After support expires, you keep using your current version. Major framework updates are typically included.
