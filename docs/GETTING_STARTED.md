    address: "Your Street Address",      // ← And this
    city: "CH-1000 Your City",          // ← And this
    phone: "+41 XX XXX XX XX",          // ← Your phone

    // ... rest stays the same for now
};

### 2. Change Your Brand Colors (2 minutes)

}
```

Try it! The theme will update immediately.

### 3. Update Site Name & Description (3 minutes)

Open `src/i18n/ui.ts` and find the `fr:` section (French):

```typescript
fr: {
